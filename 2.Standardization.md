## Standardization


```python
#before standardization

scores = [10,20,30]
n_student = len(scores)

score_sum,score_square_sum = 0,0

for score in scores:
    score_sum += score
    score_square_sum += score**2

mean = score_sum/n_student
variance = score_square_sum/n_student - mean**2
std = variance**0.5

print('mean before standardization: ', mean)
print('variance before standardization: ', variance)
print('mean before standardization: ', std)
```

    mean before standardization:  20.0
    variance before standardization:  66.66666666666669
    mean before standardization:  8.16496580927726



```python
# standardization

for student_idx in range(n_student):
    scores[student_idx] = (scores[student_idx]-mean)/std

print('scores after standardization: ',scores)
```

    scores after standardization:  [-1.224744871391589, 0.0, 1.224744871391589]



```python
# after standardization

score_sum,score_square_sum = 0,0

for score in scores:
    score_sum += score
    score_square_sum += score**2

mean = score_sum/n_student
variance = score_square_sum/n_student - mean**2
std = variance**0.5

print('mean after standardization: ', mean)
print('variance after standardization: ', variance)
print('mean after standardization: ', std)
```

    mean after standardization:  0.0
    variance after standardization:  0.9999999999999999
    mean after standardization:  1.0
